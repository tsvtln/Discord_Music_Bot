## Discord Bot v2.0.0

> This Python Discord music bot features a modular architecture designed for scalability and maintainability.
> It utilizes the discord.py library for Discord interactions, asyncio for asynchronous programming, and yt_dlp for handling YouTube video downloads.
> The bot requires a reliable internet connection with a minimum upload speed of 25Mbps.

## Architecture

**Version 2.0.0** introduces a complete modular restructure:
- **Modular Design**: Separated functionality into specialized modules for better maintainability
- **Event-Driven**: Centralized event handling through the `EventHandlers` class
- **Inheritance System**: Shared configuration through the `VARS` class inheritance model
- **Command Separation**: Individual handlers for different command types

## Dependencies

    In `requirements.txt`, you will find the necessary dependencies for this project. You can install them using pip.

## Features

### Music Functionality
    • Play Music: Stream music in Discord voice channels using YouTube URLs or search queries, with instant playback
    • Queue Management: Add multiple songs to queue with automatic sequential playback
    • Playback Controls: Pause, resume, and stop commands for full playback control
    • Queue Display: View current song queue with $queue command
    • Voice State Management: Automatic queue continuation when users leave voice channels

### Interactive Features
    • Keyword Responses: Automatic GIF and text responses to specific keywords with intelligent whole-word matching
    • Dynamic GIF Processing: All GIFs are resized (120x120) and cached for optimal Discord performance
    • Wednesday Logic: Special day-aware responses for Wednesday-related keywords
    • Weather Integration: Real-time weather data via $weather <city> command (OpenWeatherMap API)
    • Daily Fortune Draw: $kysmetche command for daily fortune draws with per-user tracking
    • Shell Command Execution: Secure whitelisted shell command execution via Discord
    • Random Daily Fact: Automatic posting of a random fact every day

## To Do

    - Buy a new car
    - Learn guitar
    - Drink more water
    - Enjoy life

### Music Commands
- `$play <song/URL>` - Play music from YouTube
- `$pause` - Pause current playback
- `$resume` - Resume paused playback  
- `$stop` - Stop playback and clear queue
- `$queue` - Display current song queue

### Utility Commands
- `$weather <city>` - Get current weather for specified city
- `$weather5 <city>` - Get 5-day weather forecast for specified city
- `$kysmetche` - Draw daily fortune (once per day per user)
- `$kysmetche reroll` - Reroll daily fortune (once per day per user)
- `$key_words` - List all available keyword triggers
- `$commands` - Show all available commands
- `$cmds` - List available shell commands

## Setup and Usage

    1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    2. Configure your Discord bot token in the appropriate configuration file
    3. Set up OpenWeatherMap API key for weather functionality
    4. Run the bot: `python run_bot.py`
    5. Invite the bot to your Discord server with appropriate permissions

## Configuration

The bot uses a modular configuration system:
- **Global Variables**: Managed through `libs/global_vars.py`
- **API Keys**: Handled via `libs/key_loaders.py`
- **Command Permissions**: Configured in the security modules
- **Keyword Responses**: Customizable through the vars system

## Migration from v1.x

Version 2.0.0 represents a complete architectural overhaul:
- **Breaking Change**: The monolithic `LoFi_bot.py` is deprecated
- **User Experience**: All commands and functionality remain identical
- **Development**: New modular structure for easier maintenance and feature additions
- **Legacy**: Old bot file kept as reference template

## Notes
- Audio streams directly from YouTube for instant playback without full downloads
- GIF responses are automatically resized and cached for optimal performance  
- All modules inherit from the `VARS` class for shared configuration access
- The modular architecture allows for independent testing and development of features
- Security features prevent unauthorized shell command execution

## Random Daily Fact Feature

- The bot now posts a random real-world fact every day at a scheduled time (default: 16:20, configurable) to one or more channels.
- Facts are fetched from the Useless Facts API, with local fallback facts if the API is unavailable.
- All facts for the day are tracked in `cache/fact_data.txt` to avoid repeats.
- The feature is implemented using APScheduler and is fully automated—no user command required.

### How it works
- At the scheduled time, the bot posts a fact to the configured channels.
- If a fact for today already exists, a new unique fact is fetched (up to 50 tries, then a fallback is used).
- To change the post time or channels, edit the scheduler setup in `bin/events.py`.

### Example
```
🧠 Daily Fact: Bananas are berries, but strawberries are not.
```

### Configuration
- Channel IDs and post time are set in `bin/events.py` in the `start_fact_scheduler` method.
- Facts are stored in `cache/fact_data.txt`.
